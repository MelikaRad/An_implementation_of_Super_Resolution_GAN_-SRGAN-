# An implementation of Super Resolution GAN (SRGAN)
This project aims to enhance the resolution of old movies using Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN). SRGAN is a deep learning-based approach that can upscale low-resolution images or videos to high-resolution ones. The project will involve implementing the SRGAN architecture to achieve super-resolution images from lower quality ones.

The project is ongoing ...
